// Distance Traveled
//
// The distance a vehicle travels can be calculated as follows:
// distance = speed * time
// For example, if a train travels 40 miles per hour for 3 hours, the distance traveled is 120 miles.
// Write a program that asks the user for the speed of a vehicle (in miles per hour) and how many hours it has traveled. The program should then use a loop to display the distance the vehicle has traveled for each hour of that time period. Here is an example of the output:
//
// What is the speed of the vehicle in mph? 40
// How many hours has it traveled? 3
//
// Hour Distance Traveled
// --------------------------------
// 1    40
// 2    80
// 3    120
// Input Validation: Do not accept a negative number for speed and do not accept any value less than 1 for time traveled.
